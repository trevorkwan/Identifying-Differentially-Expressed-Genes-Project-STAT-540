Download the 'GSE166992_RAW.tar' dataset from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE166992

Decompress the file and there are a bunch of gz files within.

I think each patient has three files attached: a matrix file, a features file, and a barcodes file. Each need to be loaded together when you use the read10X command.

```{r}
jackson_path <- '~/Documents/Measday_Lab/Masters/Courses/GSAT540/Repo_team_Quaranteam_2021W2/GSE166992_RAW/' 

library(RCurl)
library(tidyverse)
library(edgeR)
library(scater)
library(scran)


options(digits = 3) #Not sure what this does
dge <- read10X(
  mtx = 'GSM5090446_IVAR2_5DGE_matrix.mtx.gz',
  genes = 'GSM5090446_IVAR2_5DGE_features.tsv.gz',
  barcodes = 'GSM5090446_IVAR2_5DGE_barcodes.tsv.gz',
  DGEList = TRUE,
  path = jackson_path) #Change to the file location on your computer
```
